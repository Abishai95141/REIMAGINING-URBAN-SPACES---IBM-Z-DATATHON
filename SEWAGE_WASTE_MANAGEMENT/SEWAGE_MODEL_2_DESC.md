####  1. Import necessary libraries
    - Import libraries for data manipulation, model training, and time handling

####  2. Load the dataset
    - Load 'input.csv' into a DataFrame

####  3. Feature selection
    - Select columns for features (Population_Density, Household_Size, Water_Consumption, Sewage_load_normal_day, Sewage_load_eventual_day)
    - Set the target as 'Sewage_load_normal_day'

####  4. Split the data into training and test sets
    - Use an 80-20 split for training and testing

####  5. Train the model
    - Initialize RandomForestRegressor
    - Train the model using the training data

####  6. Predict sewage load
    - Use the model to predict sewage load
    - Multiply predictions by 0.57 to adjust values

####  7. Add date column
    - Convert 'Timestamp' column to datetime
    - Add 1 day to the 'Timestamp' to create 'Date' column

####  8. Save predictions
    - Save the DataFrame with the predicted sewage load and 'Date' column as 'updated_sewage_data_with_predictions.csv'

####  9. Reload the updated data
    - Load 'updated_sewage_data_with_predictions.csv' for further calculations

####  10. Calculate individual household sewage generation
    - Divide predicted sewage load by household size (in thousands) to calculate sewage generation per household
    - Round the result to three decimal places

####  11. Set sewage capacity per household
    - Set individual household sewage capacity to 1600

####  12. Calculate days left until sewage capacity is reached
    - Divide sewage capacity by household sewage generation to get days left
    - Round the result to three decimal places

####  13. Calculate hours left
    - Multiply days left by 24 to get hours left

####  14. Save the updated data
    - Save the updated DataFrame as 'updated_sewage_data_with_household_sewage.csv'

####  15. Print success message
    - Print a message indicating that predictions and updates were saved successfully
