#### 1. **Import necessary libraries**
    - Import libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, plotting, and geographic calculations.

#### 2. **Load the dataset**
    - Read the input CSV file containing the sewage-related data.

#### 3. **Select features and target**:  
    - Select the relevant columns (features) from the dataset that will be used to predict the sewage load.  
    - Define the target variable (sewage load).

#### 4. **Split the data into training and test sets**:  
    - Use an 80-20 split to separate the dataset into training and testing sets.

#### 5. **Train the model**:  
    - Initialize a `RandomForestRegressor` model and train it on the training data.

#### 6. **Make predictions**:  
    - Use the trained model to predict the future sewage load and adjust the prediction with a multiplier.

#### 7. **Add prediction date**:  
    - If a 'Timestamp' column exists in the dataset, add 1 day to the timestamp and store it in a new column.  
    - If the 'Timestamp' column is missing, display a warning message.

#### 8. **Save the updated dataset with predictions**:  
    - Save the dataset to a new CSV file containing the predicted sewage load.

#### 9. **Reload the updated dataset**:  
    - Reload the CSV file containing the predictions.

#### 10. **Calculate sewage generation per household**:  
     - Compute individual household sewage generation and capacity.

     - Save the dataset with the additional columns to a new CSV file.

#### 12. **Plot actual vs predicted sewage load**:  
     - Plot the actual sewage load against the predicted sewage load using a time series plot.

#### 13. **Generate random geographic data for zones**:  
     - For each unique zone, generate random latitude, longitude, and elevation values.

     - Use the total head, flow rate, and pump efficiency to calculate the power required for sewage pumping.

#### 30. **Save the dataset with power calculations**:  
     - Save the updated dataset to a new CSV file.

#### 31. **Calculate average and threshold sewage load**:  
     - Compute the average and peak sewage load from the dataset and define a threshold load (80% of the average).

#### 32. **Update the dataset with threshold sewage load**:  
    - Add a column for the threshold sewage load to the dataset.

#### 33. **Save the updated dataset**:
